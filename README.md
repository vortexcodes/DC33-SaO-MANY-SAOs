DC33 – SaO MANY SAOs
This is the README. So… read it. Seriously.

POWER
This badge is powered by two pre-installed 18650 batteries. You can charge them via USB or the barrel connector.

You can run the badge off:

USB

Battery

Barrel connector
(do note that when runing off of dc barrel/usb only 30 mA will be supplyed if runing all saos at ounce, but if you have charged batterys it will be 300 mA)


Note: If you're charging and the badge is switched on, it’ll stop charging and use the power to run the SAOs instead.

There’s built-in surge protection, so please don’t try to "stress test" it with a Tesla coil.

The little LEDs next to the batteries are charging indicators:

Red = Charging

Green = Full

More nerdy details (like the exact charging circuit) can be found in the schematic.

Also: The badge will get warm while charging. It will not explode. (Probably.)

WTF Are the LEDs For?
The white square LEDs around the edge of the badge are controlled by the top-left SAO slot (when looking at the front).

If you want cool LED animations and actual control, get the SmartAO SAO here:

SAOs
This beast can hold up to 25 SAOs at once. However, it can only supply around 300 mA @ 3.3V total before the onboard fuses say “nope.”

So:

Don’t plug in a bunch of power-hungry SAOs.

The more SAOs you add, the faster your battery dies (you knew this).

Each SAO port has a notch on the left side—you can tie a string or lanyard there to keep your precious SAOs from falling off.

Included in the kit are little plastic rectangles that go over an SAO and give you a leash ring. These only work with SAOs that have the keyhole-style opening at the top.

Need help before or after the con? Email:

But before you do either:
Check the schematic.
It probably has the answer you’re looking for.

RETURNS
Nope.

Every badge is tested before shipping. Unless you can prove there’s a real defect that’s actually my fault, I won’t accept returns.

Thanks for understanding—I love you, but I’m not Amazon.

THIS WAS EDITED WITH AI, FYI
